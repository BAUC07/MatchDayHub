Build a cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android) for grassroots football managers to log match activity in real time. This is a pitch-side tool designed for fast, one-handed use under pressure.

Platform & Tech
	•	Target platforms:
	•	iOS (iPhone)
	•	Android
	•	Use a single cross-platform framework (prefer Flutter or React Native)
	•	Local data persistence only (offline-first)
	•	No backend required for MVP
	•	Architecture must support future analytics and reporting features

⸻

Core Concept

Managers can manage multiple teams and log live match events accurately as they happen. During match play, all core actions must fit on a single screen with no scrolling.

All data captured must be stored in a structured way so it can be reused later for match statistics, trends, and performance analysis in future iterations.

⸻

Subscription Logic
	•	Free version:
	•	Maximum of 1 team
	•	Paid version:
	•	Unlimited teams
	•	Implement subscription logic using a simple abstraction (mock or stub acceptable)

⸻

Team & Squad Management

For each team:
	•	Create and manage squads
	•	Players have:
	•	Name
	•	Squad number (optional)
	•	Player states:
	•	Starting
	•	Substitute
	•	Unavailable

⸻

Match Setup

Before kickoff, the manager must be able to:
	•	Select team
	•	Enter opposition team name (free text)
	•	Select match location:
	•	Home
	•	Away
	•	Select match format:
	•	5v5
	•	7v7
	•	9v9
	•	11v11
	•	Select starting lineup using drag and drop from the squad
	•	Assign remaining players as substitutes or unavailable

All match metadata (opposition, home/away, format, date, team) must be saved with the match record.

⸻

Match View – Single Screen, No Scroll (Critical)

The live match screen must be fully usable on one screen, with no vertical or horizontal scrolling. The layout is fixed and divided into three vertical zones:

1. Top Bar – Awareness Zone (Fixed)
	•	Scoreline (your team vs opposition)
	•	Match clock (clearly showing added time when applicable)
	•	Pause / resume control (protected against accidental taps)

2. Middle Zone – Pitch & Players
	•	Simplified pitch diagram
	•	On-pitch players shown as circles with shirt number or initials
	•	Substitutes shown in a compact bench strip within the same screen
	•	Tapping a player opens a quick action sheet:
	•	Goal
	•	Assist
	•	Yellow card
	•	Red card
	•	Sub off
	•	Drag-and-drop supported for substitutions

This zone provides visual context only and should not scroll.

3. Bottom Action Bar – Event Logging (Fixed)

Always visible. Large tap targets.

Buttons:
	•	GOAL +
	•	GOAL –
	•	CARD
	•	SUB
	•	PENALTY

Tapping a button opens a bottom sheet (not a new screen) to capture:
	•	Player(s) involved
	•	Event type (where applicable)
	•	Confirmation

⸻

Match Clock
	•	Start match button starts the clock
	•	Clock runs continuously
	•	Pause and resume supported
	•	Ability to add additional time at end of halves
	•	All events are automatically timestamped using match time

⸻

Live Match Event Logging

Support logging of:

Goals Scored
	•	Select scorer
	•	Optional assist
	•	Goal type:
	•	Open play
	•	Corner
	•	Free kick

Goals Conceded
	•	Goal type:
	•	Open play
	•	Corner
	•	Free kick

Discipline
	•	Yellow card
	•	Red card
	•	Assigned to a player

Penalties
	•	Penalty for team
	•	Penalty against team
	•	Optional outcome (scored / missed)

Substitutions
	•	Player off
	•	Player on

All events:
	•	Are timestamped
	•	Can be edited
	•	Allow undo of the most recent action
	•	Are stored in a structured format suitable for future analysis

⸻

Timeline Access (During Match)
	•	Timeline accessible via:
	•	A small icon in the top bar, or
	•	A swipe gesture
	•	Timeline opens as an overlay or bottom sheet
	•	Displays chronological list of events with edit/delete options

⸻

End of Match Summary

At full time:
	•	Display a visual timeline:
	•	Horizontal time axis
	•	Icons for goals, cards, penalties, substitutions
	•	Summary includes:
	•	Final score
	•	Cards count
	•	Penalties

⸻

Data & Future-Proofing (Important)

All data must be stored in a way that supports future features such as:
	•	Player statistics (goals, assists, cards, minutes played)
	•	Team trends over time
	•	Home vs away performance
	•	Discipline trends
	•	Set-piece vs open-play goals
	•	Match comparisons across seasons

Design data models with extensibility in mind, even if analytics are not shown in the MVP UI.

⸻

UX Principles (Non-Negotiable)
	•	No scrolling during live match logging
	•	Large tap targets
	•	Minimal typing during matches
	•	Clear visual and haptic feedback when events are logged
	•	Designed for cold, wet, high-pressure environments

⸻

Deliverables
	•	Working cross-platform mobile app (iOS + Android)
	•	Clean, modular codebase
	•	Well-defined data models
	•	Comments explaining key architectural decisions
	•	Clear extension points for future analytics, backend sync, and reporting

Prioritise speed, clarity, and reliability over visual polish. This app should feel like something a grassroots manager would genuinely trust on the touchline.
