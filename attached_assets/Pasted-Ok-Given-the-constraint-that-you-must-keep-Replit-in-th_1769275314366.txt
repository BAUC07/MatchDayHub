Ok. Given the constraint that you must keep Replit in the loop, the prompt needs to do two things at once:
	1.	Remove all ambiguity about what “working” means
	2.	Force a solution that is immune to frozen renders, even if the underlying cause is never found

That means we stop asking Replit to “fix the timer” and instead tell it exactly how the UI must be driven, even if it feels inelegant.

Below is the prompt I’d use. It’s prescriptive on purpose. It gives Replit a narrow lane and a high probability of success.

Prompt for Replit (Guaranteed-working approach)

We need a solution that visually updates time on screen every second while the app is in the foreground, regardless of navigation optimisations, memoisation, or render freezing.

Do not attempt to debug or optimise the existing screen further. Implement the pattern below exactly.

⸻

Required approach

Decouple timekeeping from the screen render tree.
	1.	Create a standalone LiveTimer child component whose only responsibility is to render elapsed time.
	2.	LiveTimer must:
	•	Not be wrapped in React.memo
	•	Not depend on parent re-renders
	•	Manage its own internal state
	•	Be mounted directly inside the screen JSX
	3.	Inside LiveTimer:
	•	Store a local displayTick state that increments once per second
	•	Use setTimeout or setInterval solely to update this local state
	•	Calculate elapsed time from startTimestamp on each render
	•	Render the calculated value directly in JSX

Example structure (pattern, not exact code):
	•	startTimestamp passed in once as a prop
	•	displayTick increments every second to force re-render
	•	Elapsed time = Date.now() - startTimestamp

This ensures:
	•	Accurate time (timestamp-based)
	•	Guaranteed re-renders (local state updates)
	•	No reliance on parent navigation renders

⸻

Validation requirements

Add the following logs:
	•	Log inside LiveTimer render body
	•	Log inside the timer callback

Expected result:
	•	Render log fires once per second while app remains open
	•	Number visually increments once per second
	•	No app switching required

⸻

Acceptance criteria

This is considered complete only when:
	•	The timer visibly counts up once per second
	•	While the app remains in the foreground
	•	Without relying on AppState, focus changes, or navigation events
	•	On a physical iOS device via Expo Go

If this pattern does not work, the issue is confirmed to be outside the screen code and should be reported explicitly rather than iterating further.
