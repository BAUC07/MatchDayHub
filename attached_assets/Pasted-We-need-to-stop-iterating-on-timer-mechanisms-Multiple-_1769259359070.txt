We need to stop iterating on timer mechanisms. Multiple correct implementations now exist (setInterval, recursive setTimeout, requestAnimationFrame, simple counter) and all fail in the same way. This conclusively proves the issue is not timekeeping, scheduling, or iOS timer throttling.
The problem is that React renders for this screen are being blocked upstream.
Please follow the steps below exactly and in order. Do not modify the timer logic further until these are completed.
Step 1: Prove React can re-render at all
Create a temporary test component with no navigation, no parents, no providers, and no memoisation, and render it as the app root:
A single useState counter
setState(prev => prev + 1) every second
console.log in the component body (render path)
The state value rendered directly in JSX
Expected result:
The number increments visually every second
The render log fires every second
If this does not work, there is a fundamental render issue unrelated to the match screen.
Step 2: Isolate LiveMatchScreen
Render LiveMatchScreen directly as the root component:
No React Navigation
No parent wrappers
No React.memo
No useMemo / useCallback around render values
Confirm:
setMatchTime(prev => prev + 1) fires every second
The render log inside the component body fires every second
The UI visibly increments
If this works, the issue is confirmed to be navigation or parent-level optimisation.
Step 3: If navigation is involved, disable all render freezing
If LiveMatchScreen lives inside React Navigation, explicitly test with:
freezeOnBlur: false
detachInactiveScreens: false
No focus-based conditional rendering
No memoisation of the screen or any parent components
React Navigation commonly freezes renders while allowing state updates to continue. This exactly matches the observed behaviour.
Step 4: Verify the rendered value is the state itself
Confirm that:
The value shown in JSX is the state variable itself (matchTime)
It is not derived from timestamps during render
It is not passed through selectors, memoised transforms, or calculated props
The render must be as simple as:
<Text>{matchTime}</Text>
Acceptance criteria (non-negotiable)
This is considered fixed only when:
The timer visibly increments once per second
While the app remains in the foreground
Without switching apps
Without relying on AppState or focus changes
Until React reconciliation is proven to occur every second, no timer implementation will ever succeed.
